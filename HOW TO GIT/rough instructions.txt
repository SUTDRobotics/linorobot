GitHub guide
Install GitHub desktop, log in.

There is a repo online that you need to change.
(if there isn't, you have uploaded it to GitHub)

Clone the repo into one of the folders. You will be working on the project in this folder. Make the necessary changes.

When done, go to GitHub Desktop. Write something for Summary, and commit to master.

Select your repo and the club repo. Then send the pull request.

The maintainer will accept your pull request.
